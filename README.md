# OFFLINE-SIGNATURE-VERIFICATION-USING-MATLAB

As signature is the primary mechanism both for authentication and authorization in legal transactions, the
need for efficient auto-mated solutions for signature verification has increased.
Unlike a password, PIN, PKI or key cards – identification data that can be forgotten, lost, stolen or
shared – the captured values of the handwritten signature are unique to an individual and virtually impossible to
duplicate. The primary advantage that signature verification systems have over other type’s technologies
is that signatures are already accepted as the common method of identity verification. A signature verification
system and the techniques used to solve this problem can be divided into two classes Online and Off-line.
On-line approach uses an electronic tablet and a stylus connected to a computer to extract information about a 
signature and takes dynamic information like pressure, velocity, speed of writing etc. for verification purpose.
Whereas Offline signature verification involves less electronic control and uses signature images captured by
scanner or camera. An offline signature verification system uses features
extracted from scanned signature image. In this only the pixel image needs to be evaluated
